% \subsubsection{Duality and differential geometry}
% Again, the trial space $\Psi$ needs not be formed by indicator functions of domains.
% To see this more clearly, we can emphasize the duality between chains and the functions integrated over them by using inner product notation, or ``duality pairing'':
% \begin{equation}
%     \inner{-\nabla \left(\sum_{i=1}^n h_i\phi_i\right), \partial\left(\sum_{i=1}^n \omega_i \Omega_i\right)^\perp}
%     =
%     \inner{f, \sum_{i=1}^n \omega_i \Omega_i}.
% \end{equation}
% The duality pairing is an integral over the whole domain, where pieces of chains (such as the ``surface elements'' in a flux integral) are
% paired with pieces of function data of the same dimension (such as the heat gradient, or the source function).
% We can write our original (weak) Poisson problem \eqref{poisson_equation_integral} in this notation as
% \begin{align*}
%     \inner{-\nabla h, \pomn^\perp}
%     =
%     \inner{f, \omn}.
% \end{align*}
% for arbitrary control volumes $\Omega_0$. The $\perp$ symbol denotes an orthogonal complement, as
% we would like to pair gradient vectors with \textit{normals} to the boundary rather than the boundary elements themselves,
% as we are calculating total fluxes. More formally, in differential
% geometry, this should be denoted by the ``Hodge star'' operator $\star$, which we will use from now on, as
% it will be convenient to think of the orthogonal complement as an operator acting by multiplication:
% \begin{equation}\label{poisson_duality}
%     \inner{-\nabla h, \star\pomn}
%     =
%     \inner{f, \omn}.
% \end{equation}
% By Stokes' theorem we have the form
% \begin{align*}
%     \inner{-\nabla \cdot \nabla h, \omn}
%     =
%     \inner{f, \omn}.
% \end{align*}
% The duality pairing is in fact an inner product, so we see that operator
% $\star\partial$ is \textit{adjoint} to $\nabla\cdot$.
% This is exactly what Stokes' theorem was created to say, albeit expressed in a more abstract language.
% We may ask why we must restrict the chain to be an indicator function. Why not ``integrate against'' some other function,
% \begin{align*}
%     \inner{-\nabla \cdot \nabla h, \psi}
%     =
%     \inner{f, \psi}?
% \end{align*}
% Yet does the form
% \begin{align*}
%     \inner{-\nabla h, \star\partial \psi}
%     =
%     \inner{f, \psi}
% \end{align*}
% make sense?

In the derivations of chapter (), many of the manipulations were trivial applications of linearity and splitting of
boundary and interior terms, and is standard in the finite element literature to define forms such as the $a$ and $L$ above.
If we discretize to $n$ (interior) basis functions
there are $2n$ basis functions for the mixed test and trial spaces, which are the natural choice:
\begin{equation}\label{mixed_space_basis_functions}
\begin{split}
    \Phi^\mathcal{M} &= \text{span}\left(
        (\phi_1, 0),\cdots,(\phi_n, 0), (0,\phi_1^p),\cdots,(0,\phi_n^p)
    \right),\\
    \Psi^\mathcal{M} &= \text{span}\left(
        (\psi_1, 0),\cdots,(\psi_n, 0), (0,\psi_1^p),\cdots,(0,\psi_n^p).
    \right)
\end{split}
\end{equation}


All we must do is plug approximations, from finite dimensional function spaces, into the weak form \eqref{steady_stokes_bilinear_form}, 
while performing trial integrals only over the basis functions in the a finite dimensional mixed trial space, resulting in the
linear system of equations
\begin{equation}\label{stokes_flow_mixed_equations_1}
\begin{split}
    a((\tilde{u}, \tilde{p}), (\psi_j, 0)) &= L((\psi_j, 0)), \quad j = 1,\cdots,n\\
    a((\tilde{u}, \tilde{p}), (0, \psi^p_j)) &= L((0, \psi^p_j)), \quad j = 1,\cdots,n,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We must choose the finite-dimensional spaces $\Phi,\Psi,\Phi_{\text{constraint}},$ and $\Psi_{\text{constraint}}$.
The algorithm for the Stokes problem, with Dirichlet boundary conditions, will then consist of forming the matrix and right-hand side of
\eqref{stokes_flow_abstract_linear_system}, then passing it to a linear solver.

====================================================================================================

As explained in the note on tensor notation, the left-most summation is over contractions of $u^i$ with the ``vectorized''
bilinear form $a$, as $\phi_i$ is an aggregate of vector fields, $\phi_i = (\phi_{ix}, \phi_{iy})^T$.

The $\psi_l^\mathcal{M}$ mixed trial function ranges over all basis trial functions, \ref{mixed_space_basis_functions}.
Suppose $\psi_l^\mathcal{M} = (\psi_1, 0)$. We have $\psi_1 = \phi_1$ (due to using Bubnov--Galerkin), which is the aggregate of vector fields defined in the note on tensor notation. Therefore this one apparent equation, with $\psi_l^\mathcal{M} = (\psi_1, 0)$ actually defines two equations,
\begin{align*}
    \sum_{i=1}^n u_i\cdot a((\phi_i, 0), (\psi_{1x}, 0)) + \sum_{i=1}^n p_ia((0, \phi_i^p), (\psi_{1x}))
        = L((\psi_{1x}, 0)) - a((\tilde{u}_\Gamma, 0), (\psi_{1x}, 0)),\\
    \sum_{i=1}^n u_i\cdot a((\phi_i, 0), (\psi_{1y}, 0)) + \sum_{i=1}^n p_ia((0, \phi_i^p), (\psi_{1y}))
        = L((\psi_{1y}, 0)) - a((\tilde{u}_\Gamma, 0), (\psi_{1y}, 0)).
\end{align*}

Therefore equation \eqref{stokes_flow_abstract_linear_system}
forms a $(2n + n_p) \times (2n + n_p)$ linear system (with $2n$ coefficients for the velocity, $n_p$ for the pressure).

\textit{Automation}
\vskip 0.1in

It has been very beneficial to go from the weak form of our specific Stokes problem
\eqref{steady_stokes_weak} to the abstract form \eqref{steady_stokes_bilinear_form} in terms of the forms $a$ and $L$.
When the approximating solutions $\tilde{u}$ and $\tilde{p}$ are plugged in, all that
takes place is a linear expansion and rearrangement, accounting for boundary terms.

It is feasible that this process could be automated, as in, we could pass a symbolic representation of the weak form
\eqref{steady_stokes_weak}, a mesh discretizing the domain, a specification of the finite element function spaces
(in some symbolic notation such as ``\texttt{P1 x P2\_2}''),
and boundary conditions. This is all the data specific to our problem --- with this data, the finite element algorithm
is fully specified, and it is a routine task to do all the expansions and rearrangements to specify the linear system,
then to write a matrix assembly algorithm to traverse the mesh and construct this system.

This in fact has been done
\cite{fenics_book} \cite{DOLFIN} \cite{firedrake} \cite{automating_fem},
and is an active area of research.

% The approximated pressure is $\tilde{p} \in \Phi_{\text{pressure}}$ where
%     $$\Phi_{\text{pressure}} = \text{span}(\phi_{pi},\cdots,\phi_{pn}).$$
% The pressure is zero on the boundary ($\left.p\right|_\Gamma = 0$), as it is only meaningful with respect to
% integrals over interior control volumes,
% so we have
%     $$\tilde{p} = \sum_{i=1}^n p_i \phi_{pi}.$$
% The velocity vector field $u$ is discretized as
%     $$\tilde{u} =  \phi_\Gamma + \phi = \phi_\Gamma + \sum_{i=1}^n u_i\phi_i$$
% where $\phi_\Gamma$ is the boundary approximation in $\Phi^*$, as in chapter ().

% To simplify matters, we let the vector field test and trial spaces be direct sums of scalar function spaces:
% $$
%     \Phi^* = \Phi^*_s \oplus \Phi^*_s,
%     \quad
%     \Psi^* = \Psi^*_s \oplus \Psi^*_s,
% $$
% where the $s$ subscript denotes ``scalar''. This means
% that the first equation in \eqref{steady_stokes_linear_system} splits into
% two equations, for the $x$ and $y$ components of the velocity $u$.
% Equation \eqref{steady_stokes_linear_system} is a $3n \times 3n$ linear system which (with the right choice of test and trial spaces) will be rank $3n - 1$,
% as the pressure is defined up to a constant.

% We introduce notation for the bilinear and linear forms in \eqref{steady_stokes_weak}:
% \begin{equation}
% \begin{split}
%     a(u, v) &\coloneqq \int_\om-\mu\nabla u : \nabla v\,dx,\quad\text{for $u \in \Phi, v \in \Psi$},\\
%     \hat{b}(p, v) &\coloneqq \int_\om-\left(\nabla\cdot v\right)p\,dx,\quad\text{for $p \in \testpressure, v \in \Psi$},\\
%     b(u, q) &\coloneqq \int_\om-\left(\nabla\cdot u\right)q\,dx,\quad\text{for $u \in \Phi, q \in \trialconstraint$},\\
%     f(v) &\coloneqq \int_\om \rho g\cdot v\,dx\quad\text{for $v \in \Psi$}.
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% Although they have the same form, $b$ and $\hat{b}$ are distinguished as they take inputs in different function spaces.
% We now have a simplified notation for the weak form \eqref{steady_stokes_weak},
% \begin{equation}\label{steady_stokes_weak_notation}
% \begin{split}
%     &a(u, v) + \hat{b}(p, v) = f(v),\\
%     &b(u, q) = 0, \quad\text{where $v \in \Psi, q \in \trialconstraint$}.
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% % Solving for $u^*$ in the equation $a(u^*, v) = f(v)$ is the standard vector Poisson equation, resulting in a symmetric-positive-definite
% % system when the test and trials spaces are discretized. We can imagine letting $p = 0$ and solving for $u^*$.
% % The first condition of \eqref{steady_stokes_weak_notation} will hold, but the second condition (does $b(u^*, q) = 0$?) generally will not.
% Working with discrete function spaces, we get a $2n\times 2n$ linear system in the unknowns $u_1,\cdots,u_n$ and $p_1,\cdots,p_n$,
% \begin{equation}
% \begin{split}
%     &\sum_{i=1}^n u_i a\left(\phi_i, \psi_j\right) + \sum_{i=1}^np_i\hat{b}\left(\phi^C_i, \psi_j\right) = f(\psi_j),\\
%     &\sum_{i=1}^nu_ib\left(\phi_i, \psi^C_j\right) = 0,\quad j=1,\cdots.n.

% \subsubsection{Is this method reasonable?}
% For the vector Poisson equation, letting $\Phi = \Psi$, we ended up with a symmetric-positive-definite system \eqref{elliptic_bilinear_form_matrix}, which is known to be stably solvable.
% We can ask how reasonable it is to solve \eqref{steady_stokes_matrix}, and what trial and test spaces we should use.
% In fact, in the problem \eqref{steady_stokes_weak_notation}, and more generally in a ``saddle point problem'', arising
% in Lagrange-multiplier methods for constrained PDEs, we should not choose just any test and trial spaces.
% The Ladyzhenskaya--Babu\v{s}ka--Brezzi condition, discussed later, enforces restrictions on choices that result in a stable method.
% We will until then continue with computations.

% \subsection{Discretizing the unsteady Stokes equations}\label{discretizing_unsteady_stokes}
% % <<<
% \newcommand{\uprev}{{u_{\text{prev}}}}
% The steady Stokes above are the stable state of the time-dependent Stokes flow,
% after the transient flow behaviour settles down. The unsteady Stokes equations \eqref{unsteady_stokes} are
% \begin{equation*}
%     \rho\Part{u}{t} = \mu\Delta u + \rho g - \nabla p, \quad \nabla\cdot u = 0.
% \end{equation*}
% These form an initial-boundary-value problem, and this will be our first attempt at discretizing a PDE in time.
% We could think of solving with the test and trial spaces over the domain $\Omega \times [0, T)$, but this is typically not done due to the memory costs,
% and different qualitative meaning of the time variable \cite{ham_fem}. Instead, we will use an implicit-Euler finite difference in time: 
% \begin{equation}\label{unsteady_stokes_implicit_euler}
%     \frac{\rho}{\Delta t} \left(u^{(n)} - u^{(n-1)}\right) = \mu\Delta u^{(n)} + \rho g - \nabla p^{(n)}, \quad \nabla\cdot u^{(n)} = 0,
% \end{equation}
% where $\Delta t$ is a fixed time step, and $u^{(n)}$ and $p^{(n)}$ is the solution at time $t_n = n\Delta t$. We can weaken each step
% \eqref{unsteady_stokes_implicit_euler}
% by integrating against trial functions $v \in \Psi$ and $q \in \trialconstraint$, performing integration by parts as in section \ref{discretizing_steady_stokes},
% and rearranging the knowns and unknowns. We can also let $u$ be $u^{(n)}$, $p$ be $p^{(n)}$, and $\uprev$ be $u^{(n-1)}$ in the above to simplify
% subsequent notation. The weak form of \eqref{unsteady_stokes_implicit_euler} is then:
% % \begin{equation}\label{unsteady_stokes_implicit_euler_weak}
% % \begin{split}
% %     \frac{\rho}{\Delta t} \int_\om \left(u^{(n)} - u^{(n-1)}\right)\cdot v\,dx
% %         &= \int_\om \mu\nabla u^{(n)}:\nabla v + \rho g\cdot v + \left(\nabla\cdot v\right) p^{(n)}\,dx,\\
% %     \quad \int_\om \left(\nabla\cdot u^{(n)}\right) q\,dx &= 0.
% % \end{split}
% % \end{equation}
% \begin{equation}\label{unsteady_stokes_implicit_euler_weak}
% \begin{split}
%     \int_\om \frac{\rho}{\Delta t} u\cdot v - \mu\nabla u:\nabla v - \left(\nabla\cdot v\right)p\,dx
%         &= \int_\om \frac{\rho}{\Delta t}\uprev\cdot v + \rho g \cdot v\,dx,\\
%     \quad \int_\om \left(\nabla\cdot u\right) q\,dx &= 0,
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% % and with the linear form definitions in section \ref{discretizing_steady_stokes} this is
% % \begin{equation}\label{unsteady_stokes_implicit_euler_weak_notation}
% % \begin{split}
% %     &\int_\om \frac{\rho}{\Delta t} u\cdot v \,dx + a(u, v) + \hat{b}(p, v) = \int_\om \frac{\rho}{\Delta t} \uprev\cdot v \,dx + f(v),\\
% %     &b(u, q) = 0, \quad\text{where $v \in \Psi, q \in \trialconstraint$}.
% % \end{split}
% % \end{equation}
% We can define the linear forms as
% \begin{equation}
% \begin{split}
%     a(u, v) &\coloneqq \int_\om\frac{\rho}{\Delta t}u\cdot v -\mu\nabla u : \nabla v\,dx,\quad\text{for $u \in \Phi, v \in \Psi$},\\
%     \hat{b}(p, v) &\coloneqq \int_\om-\left(\nabla\cdot v\right)p\,dx,\quad\text{for $p \in \testpressure, v \in \Psi$},\\
%     b(u, q) &\coloneqq \int_\om-\left(\nabla\cdot u\right)q\,dx,\quad\text{for $u \in \Phi, q \in \trialconstraint$},\\
%     f(v) &\coloneqq \int_\om \frac{\rho}{\Delta t}\uprev\cdot v + g\cdot v\,dx\quad\text{for $v \in \Psi$}
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% to reexpress \eqref{unsteady_stokes_implicit_euler_weak} in the notation
% \begin{equation}
% \begin{split}
%     &a(u, v) + \hat{b}(p, v) = f(v),\\
%     &b(u, q) = 0, \quad\text{where $v \in \Psi, q \in \trialconstraint$}.
% \end{split}
% \end{equation}
% This is the same structure as in the steady Stokes system \eqref{steady_stokes_weak_notation},
% and so the matrix block structure is the same as in \eqref{steady_stokes_matrix}. Therefore, every step we need to solve a linear system
% that is very similar to the steady Stokes problem. In fact this step can be thought of as successively introducing the momentum source $\rho g$
% (ignoring convection), while solving for the updated pressure needed to keep the fluid non-compressed.
% 
% \subsubsection{Discretizing the initial condition}
% We may have some analytically determined, or otherwise, initial velocity field $u$ with $\nabla\cdot u = 0$.
% We would like to form $u^{(0)}$ in order to start the iteration. The velocity $u$ should be projected in some way into the test space $\Psi$.
% Enforcing $u^{(0)}$ to give the same ``blurred average'' value when evaluated against a trial function,
% \begin{equation}\label{initial_velocity_projection}
%     \int_\om u^{(0)}\cdot v\,dx = \int_\om u \cdot v\,dx,\quad \forall v \in \Psi,
% \end{equation}
% gives a linear system
% \begin{equation}\label{initial_velocity_projection_linear_system}
%     \sum_{i=1}^n u^{(0)}_i \int_\om \phi_i \cdot \psi_j\,dx = \int_\om u\cdot \psi_j\,dx,
%     \quad j=1,\cdots,n.
% \end{equation}
% Solving this linear system for the $u^{(0)}_i$ gives $u^{(0)} = \sum_{i=1}^n u^{(0)}_i \phi_i$ as a projection of $u$ onto $\Phi$.
% This projection is orthogonal if $\Phi = \Psi$, and therefore could be considered the ``best'' such projection in the Euclidean norm.
% This is the standard Gramian matrix construction for projection in approximation theory \cite{approximation_theory}.

% \cite{ciarlet}, \cite{ham_fem}, \cite{fenics_book}
% 
% 
% % Discuss Ciarlet definition, difference between FEM, spectral etc. FEM uses a domain partition to help in constructing the basis functions.
% 
% One great utility of the finite element method is that it is compatible with complex geometric domains and domain partitions.
% Some greater effort is needed to apply finite differences correctly across complex boundaries, and it is non-trivial to implement
% a varying resolution of the discretisation. In the finite element method, however, specifying the test and trial functions over
% a square grid is much the same as specifying them over, for example, a surface mesh of arbitrary topology. For modelling, for example,
% heat transfer in a complex solid, one can construct basis functions over a grid on the interior, and over cut-off boundary cells near the exterior.
% This is all in principle, of course, as one needs to
% \begin{enumerate}
%     \item Break the domain up into small pieces.
%     \item Construct the basis and trial functions over this domain partition (e.g. by finding polynomial coefficients).
%     \item Compute all inner products of test and trial functions, and their relevant derivatives, either numerically or analytically.
%     \item Solve possibly many huge sparse linear systems, while possibly changing the structure of the domain partition (requiring changes to the inner products).
% \end{enumerate}
% 
% Step (1) is already a field in itself, as evidenced by the open source tool TetGen \cite{tetgen}.
% TetGen is a small tool whose primary purpose is to perform \textit{constrained Delaunay tetrahedralization}, given a solid boundary and a point cloud on the interior.
% This constructs a valid tetrahedral partition intended for finite element solvers. The partition is efficiently created in a very robust manner in over 36k lines of C code. TetGen is part of the geometric backbone of many FEA tools (references).
