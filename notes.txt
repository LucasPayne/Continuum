Stokes' theorem is the conceptual motivation for the exterior derivative.
A differential form is an alternating multilinear form. Alternatingness gives
homogeneous identification of the form's action on subspaces (if a subspace is rebasis'd,
the evaluation of the form changes by the determinant of the transformation matrix).

So, a differential form "acts on subspaces". The exterior derivative of a p-form
evaluates the limit of a boundary integral along a small element of dimension p+1.

Physical differential equations can be derived by conservation laws. This integral formulation
is very conceptual and geometric. Universal quantifiers over integrals ("over any region, the total energy going
out must be equal to the source", etc.)  are "simplified" to differential equations by Stokes' theorem.
Stokes' theorem is not just a tool here used because it works. Really, Stokes' theorem was defined exactly so
that this transformation of integral quantifiers to point-wise differential properties can be done.

Then the problem is to go back from the differential formulation to the integral one. Galerkin methods more naturally
reason about the original, integral form.

The "test space" is actually a space of chains. A chain generalizes a domain.
In an integral of a domain against a form, there is a duality between them. You can add and multiply forms,
and therefore it is natural to generalize a domain to arbitrary functions/chains. The original idea of a domain
corresponds to the characteristic function of the subset.

Consider some flux function h which transports some energy in a domain.
To say "energy is conserved" we write the integral equation
    integral_{subdomain boundary} dot(h, n)dx = 0
where n is the normal pointing outward from the boundary.

Fourier's law that heat flux is proportional to the negative gradient of heat gives,
letting u be the heat distribution,
    integral_{subdomain boundary} dot(grad(u), n)dx = 0.
Since this is quantified over subdomains, if we can assume that the behaviour of the integral on smaller and smaller subdomains
everywhere has a limit, then we use the concept of exterior derivative (and Stokes' theorem) to give
    integral_{subdomain} div grad(u) = 0,
which, since it must vanish for all subdomains, vanishes pointwise (at least except for a set of measure zero...),
    div grad(u) = 0.
This is the Laplace equation.

Now, starting at the Laplace equation, how can we recover the conservation law over subdomains?
Just define the subdomain and integrate over it. Everything is exactly backwards.
However, in a Galerkin method, we can't quantify over all subdomains. We want some discretization of the "space"
of subdomains, so we only need to guarantee that the "conservation laws" hold on certain subdomains.

Suppose we have a given u (a general u, not necessarily from some finite-dimensional trial space).
The conservation law is that, over every subdomain, we have
    integral_{subdomain boundary} dot(grad(u), n)dx = 0.
This is the general form we started with, motivated physically by Fourier's law and conservation of heat.

How do we "discretize" the space of all subdomains? We could break it into pieces subdomain_1, subdomain_2, ...
and require that
    integral_{subdomain_1 boundary} dot(grad(u), n)dx = 0,
    integral_{subdomain_2 boundary} dot(grad(u), n)dx = 0,
    ...
(--------TODO: Is this method related to finite volumes?)
However it is fruitful to think of the full duality between integrand and domain.

"integral_{subdomain boundary} dot(grad(u), n)dx = 0"
is a strange notation, giving n dependent on the integral element of the boundary.
Really, this can be written
    integral_{subdomain boundary} du(n) dx = 0
 == integral_{subdomain boundary} (hodge_star)du = 0.
du(n)dx is a scalar multiple of the volume form dx. Evaluated against the volume chain,
we are integrating over du(n). (hodge_star)du avoids the use of "n", since
(hodge_star)du paired with the (boundary) volume chain measures du against the orthogonal subspace
of the volume chain (the normal of the hypersurface).

We now have
    integral_{subdomain boundary} (hodge_star)du = 0.
Now by Stokes' theorem
 == integral_{subdomain} d(hodge_star)du = 0,
so clearly d(hodge_star) is another way to express the divergence (here taking a 1-form to an n-form, which makes
sense since it is defined by the limit of a hypersurface integral restricted to an n-dim subspace, the whole space).

Now, since we are quantifying over subdomains, but want to "discretize the space of subdomains", it is useful
to reveal the duality between the integrand and domain,
 == integral_{domain} d(hodge_star)du Indicator(subdomain) = 0.
Replace Indicator(subdomain), quantified over subdomains, with v from some "test space".
 == integral_{domain} d(hodge_star)du v = 0.
Now, of course, there is no notion of "subdomain boundary", but we want to forget that we "differentialised", requiring
that d(hodge_star)d exists everywhere in the domain for u (as in, the limit of the flux integral exists and is unique for all boundary hypersurfaces
shrinking into the point).
However, the exterior derivative is dual to the boundary operator (this idea being written as Stokes' theorem).

    integral_{subdomain} d(hodge_star)du                            (1)
  = integral_{domain} d(hodge_star)du Indicator(subdomain)          (2)
  = integral_{subdomain_boundary} (hodge_star)du                    (Stokes' from (1))
How do we get (Stokes' from (2))?
Replace Indicator(subdomain) by some test function v (working generally with the duality of integrand and domain).
  = integral_{domain} d(hodge_star)du v

integral_{domain} d(hodge_star)du v
    = integral_{domain_boundary} (hodge_star)du v
        +- integral_{domain} (hodge_star)du ^ dv
If v is constant, the second term cancels. If it is not constant, then
the second term measures the "extent of miscalculation" due to changes in boundary integrals when moving the central point (...).

Think of Dirac deltas and distributions.
The gradient of the indicator function of a subdomain is 0 everywhere except on the boundary,
where it is an "infinite normal vector".

  integral_{subdomain_boundary} u
= integral_{subdomain} du
= integral du Indicator(subdomain)

  integral u ^ dIndicator(subdomain)
= integral_{subdomain_boundary} u
Maybe it would be useful to explicitly mention the Trace operator (pullback of boundary inclusion).




A fluid element has the usual differentialization of the Reynolds transport theorem,
so it accounts for compression.
A property "per unit volume" of a fluid element could then be thought of as a property
of an "ideal point".
